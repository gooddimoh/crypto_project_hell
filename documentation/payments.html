                <p>
                    To accept deposits you need to configure at least one Payment gateway. First, input necessary gateway account details
                    (such as public key, private key etc) on the <b>Settings</b> page, <b>Add-on: Payments</b> tab.
                    Then make sure this gateway is enabled on the <b>Payment gateways</b> page. You also need to specify the default currency
                    you will accept deposits in and the reference rate, which is used to convert deposited money from real currency into credits.
                </p>

                </div>
                <p>
                    Please sign up at <a href="https://www.coinpayments.net/" target="_blank">coinpayments.net</a>, obtain merchant ID,
                    public and private keys and input them in the app settings in the backend.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After signing up with <a href="https://www.coinpayments.net/" target="_blank">coinpayments.net</a> you
                    need to enable certain coins, which users are allowed to use for deposits and withdrawals.
                    Apart from that you have to set the following permissions for the coinpayments.net API key (Account --> API keys --> Edit permissions):
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>get_basic_info</li>
                    <li>create_transaction</li>
                    <li>get_tx_info</li>
                    <li>balances</li>
                    <li>create_withdrawal</li>
                    <li>Allow auto_confirm = 1 in create_withdrawal (only in case you like to enable auto confirmation of withdrawals)</li>
                    <li>get_withdrawal_info</li>
                    <li>rates</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    For security reasons it's recommended that email confirmation is <b>required</b> for any withdrawals from your account
                    (Account Settings --> Login & Security).
                </p>
            </div>

                </div>
                <p>
                    On the <b>Withdrawal methods</b> page you can choose which methods are available to users when creating a withdrawal request.
                    There are couple of methods available by default, but you are free to create your own methods.
                    Of course, custom withdrawal methods do not support automatic processing and you will need to take care
                    of transferring funds manually.
                </p>
            </div>

                </div>
                <p>
                    Withdrawals can be processed manually or automatically (coinpayments.net method only).
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you want a want withdrawal request to be processed automatically you need to open the request page
                    by clicking <b>View</b> button on the <b>Withdrawals</b> page in the backend and click <b>Approve & Send</b> button.
                    An automatic transaction to transfer the requested amount of coins from your coinpayments.net account to the specified user address
                    will be initiated (note that credits are automatically converted into coins using the reference rate and live market rates).
                    When this transaction is completed (specific number of confirmations is received from the blockchain)
                    coinpayments.net will send an instant payment notification (IPN) to your website and the request will be automatically marked as <b>Completed</b>.
                    In order for this process to work you need to make sure that the <b>Secret key</b> provided in the settings is the same
                    as in your coinpayments.net account and that external IPN requests are not blocked (e.g. by CloudFlare, proxy server or firewall).
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you want to process a withdrawal request manually
                    you can send the requested funds directly to the client and then click <b>Complete</b> button
                    to finish the withdrawal request.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To cancel a withdrawal request and return credits back to the user account click <b>Reject</b>.
